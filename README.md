# Reinforcement-Learning

My programming assignments for the Practical Reinforcement Learning course by HSE University - Coursera.

I highly recommend reading 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction' by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

Note: W4_A2 assignment takes a long time on colab and the kernel may be disconnected before the training is completed.
